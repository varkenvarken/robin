# robin
SoC design targeted at the iCEbreaker board

![Python files](https://github.com/varkenvarken/robin/workflows/Python%20files/badge.svg) Main python files pass pep8

![Libraries](https://github.com/varkenvarken/robin/workflows/Libraries/badge.svg) libc examples can be compiled, assembled and simulated with correct results

![Simulations](https://github.com/varkenvarken/robin/workflows/Simulations/badge.svg) all instructions can be simulated correctly in the simulator

(that last bit does not imply that de hardware works, there are separate testcases for that but I cannot run them on GitHub)
