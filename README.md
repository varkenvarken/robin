# robin
SoC design targeted at the iCEbreaker board

![Python files](https://github.com/varkenvarken/robin/workflows/Python%20files/badge.svg) Main python files pass pep8

![Simulations](https://github.com/varkenvarken/robin/workflows/Simulations/badge.svg) all instructions can be simulated correctly and libc examples can be compiled, assembled and simulated with correct results

(that last bit does not imply that de hardware works, there are separate testcases for that but I cannot run them on GitHub)
